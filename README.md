# Finch Python Package Description
## Description of Files

**finch.py** - Contains the Finch API functions for controlling Finch.

**finchconnection.py** - Contains low level functions for sending and receiving data over USB, used by finch.py.

**hidapi32/64.dll**, **libhidapi.dylib**, **libhidapi32/64.so**, **libhidapipi.so** - compiled C libraries used by finchconnection.py to scan for USB devices for the Finch robot and opens a connection. Windows uses the ```.dll``` files, OSX uses the ```.dylib``` files, and Linus uses the ```.so``` files.

**testfinchfunctions.py** - Example Python program.

## Finch API

### General
#### ```close```

Closes the connection to the Finch

**Usage:** Call this when your program is exiting to cleanly close the Finch connection. This will shut off the motors and then send the Finch back to idle mode (color changing)

#### ```halt```
Convenience function to shut off the Finch LED and finch motors

**Usage:** Call whenever you wish the Finch to stop moving and turn off its LED with one function call. Will not shut off the buzzer.

### Outputs

#### ```led```
Controls the Finch beak color.

**Usage:**
```python
finch.led('#0000FF') # Hex triplet string
finch.led(0, 0, 255) # red, green, blue. 0-255 RGB values
```

#### ```wheels```
Controls the power sent to the left and right wheels.

**Usage:** Values must range from -1.0 to 1.0 for each wheel.

```python
finch.wheels(1.0, 1.0) # full forward
finch.wheels(-1.0, -1.0) # full reverse
finch.wheels(0.7, -0.3) # 70% forward on left wheel, 30% reverse on right wheel
finch.wheels(0.0, 0.0) # full stop
```

#### ```buzzer```
Outputs sound over the Finch buzzer

**Usage:** Pass two parameters, duration in seconds followed by frequency in Hertz. Frequencies between 20 and 20,000 are audible.

```python
finch.buzzer(0.5, 440). # plays 440 Hz note for 1‚ÅÑ2 second
```

Note that this function does not delay program execution; to delay, use buzzer_with_delay. If two buzzer functions are called one after the other, only the second will play. For example, the following will only play a single 880 Hz note:

```python
finch.buzzer(0.5, 220)
finch.buzzer(0.5, 880)
```

#### ```buzzer_with_delay```
Outputs sound over the Finch buzzer, then blocks the program for delay equal to the duration of the note. Same usage as buzzer.

### Sensors

#### ```temperature```
Returns temperature in degrees Celcius.

**Usage:**
```python
my_temperature = finch.temperature()
```

#### ```light```
Returns the left and right light sensor readings, values range from 0.0 (dark) to 1.0 (bright) 

**Usage:**
```python
left_light_sensor, right_light_sensor = finch.light()
```

#### ```obstacle```
Returns obstacle sensor readings, values are False for no obstacle, True for obstacle detected

**Usage:**
```python
left_obstacle, right_obstacle = finch.obstacle()
```

#### ```acceleration```
Returns (```x```, ```y```, ```z```, ```tap```, ```shake```).

**Usage:** ```x```, ```y```, and ```z```, are the acceleration readings in units of G's, and range from -1.5 to 1.5. When the finch is horizontal, z is close to 1, x, y close to 0. When the finch stands on its tail, y, z are close to 0, x is close to -1. When the finch is held with its left wing down, x, z are close to 0, y is close to 1. ```tap```, ```shake``` are boolean values; ```true``` if the corresponding event has happened.
